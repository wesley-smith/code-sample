# Python Code Sample

This is a code sample written for Oak Ridge National Laboratory, inspired by [this example](https://github.com/ornl-training/code-sample-examples). The intended outcome is to provide a view into what my Python code typically looks like, not necessarily to provide a useful system in any way. As requested, OOP methods will be  emphasized.

## Motivation
I'm especially attracted to some of the research areas ORNL supports - specifically clean energy and astronomy/astrophysics. As such, I decided to follow one of these areas with my sample. Similar to [one of my OMSCS projects](https://cse6242-sp19-g52-dashapp.herokuapp.com/), which used real-world climate and energy data, here, I'll be using "fake-world" energy data to produce some "analysis" of the energy mix of a few fictitious cities.
